# A/B Testing Ad Campaigns â€“ Kindle Ads  

## Overview  
This project analyzes two Kindle ad campaigns (**AKIN9326** and **AKIN8012**) using A/B testing to determine their effectiveness in driving conversions. The goal is to optimize ad spend while maximizing conversions and engagement.  

## Objectives  
- Compare **conversion rates** between the two campaigns.  
- Analyze **Click Through Rate (CTR)** to assess ad relevance.  
- Evaluate **cost per conversion** for budget efficiency.  
- Identify audience demographics (age, gender, interest) influencing ad performance.  

## Key Findings  

1. **Campaign Performance:**  
   - **AKIN9326** performed better in total clicks, ad expenditure, and conversions.  
   - **AKIN8012** had a higher **CTR** and lower cost per conversion.  

2. **Demographic Insights:**  
   - **Age Group 30-34** responded best to AKIN8012.  
   - **Age Groups 35-49** preferred AKIN9326.  
   - **Females (F)** contributed more conversions across both campaigns.  

3. **Audience Interest:**  
   - **Business & Industry** interest group had the most conversions.  
   - **Entertainment (Reading) and Games** audiences had lower engagement.  

4. **Cost Efficiency:**  
   - **AKIN8012** was the most cost-effective campaign.  
   - **AKIN9326** had higher conversion costs but better overall engagement.  

## Methodology  

- **Data Cleaning:** Handling duplicates, missing values, and inconsistencies.  
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Visualizing trends using Pandas, Seaborn, and Plotly.  
- **Statistical Testing:** Chi-square tests to compare campaign differences.  
- **Performance Metrics:** CTR, conversion rate, and cost per conversion calculations.  

## Tools Used  
- **Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly, Optuna)** for data analysis.  
- **Scipy** for statistical significance testing.  

## Conclusion  
- **AKIN9326 is the best-performing campaign** in terms of engagement and conversions but is more expensive.  
- **AKIN8012 is more cost-efficient** but has a lower total conversion count.  
- Future optimizations should focus on **reducing conversion costs for AKIN9326** while maintaining its high engagement.
