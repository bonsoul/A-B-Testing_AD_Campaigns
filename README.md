# A-B-Testing_AD_Campaigns

Kindle Ad Campaigns

    Campaign AKIN9326 focuses on promoting the long-term benefits of reading in one's professional life and emphasizes how Kindle can facilitate reading.
    Campaign AKIN8012 aims to instill fear in people's minds about the potential negative impact on their professional career if they don't read regularly.

GOAL/OBJECTIVE

    The primary goal is to determine which ad campaign, AKIN9326 or AKIN8012, resulted in more conversions for the Kindle product.
    Conversions serve as a key metric for evaluating the effectiveness of each ad campaign in driving user engagement and sales.
    A higher conversion rate suggests that more users took the desired action, such as purchasing a Kindle, in response to the ad campaign.
    Comparing the cost per conversion between the two campaigns can provide insights into the efficiency of acquiring new customers.
    Analyzing the Click Through Rate (CTR) helps assess the relevance and appeal of each ad, potentially influencing conversion rates.
    The number of ad clicks is another factor to consider, as it may correlate with higher conversion rates if the ad content resonates with users.
    Efforts should be made to optimize ad expenditure while maximizing conversions to achieve the best return on investment.
    Preference is given to ad campaigns with higher values of Total Conversions and Total Approved Conversions, indicating successful customer acquisition.
